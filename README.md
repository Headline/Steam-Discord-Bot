# Steam-Discord-Bot
This a fairly simple steam discord bot which provides notifications on game updates along with some useful commands. 

## Installation
- Install latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/Headline22/Steam-Discord-Bot/releases/tag/Steam-Discord-Bot-v1.0.6).
- Ensure that you set up Settings.xml before you run the program.
- Run it.

## Credits 
Much of the code was adapted from [VoiDeD's bot](https://github.com/VoiDeD/steam-irc-bot/), so many thanks for the guidance. Also I'd like to thank the guys on #opensteamworks in gamesurge irc.
